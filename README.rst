Seashore
========

Seashore provides a shell abstraction,
to allow easily writing UNIX automation things in Python.
Many primitives have the primary interface being as command-lines:
for example, :code:`apt-get` and :code:`yum`.
Though sometimes there is a Python library,
such as in the case of :code:`docker` and :code:`docker-py`,
it is often the case that there is a shell script that quickly needs
to be ported 1-1.
